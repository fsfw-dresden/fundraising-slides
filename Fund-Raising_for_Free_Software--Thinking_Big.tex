 \item There are already similar attempts (e.\,g. \href{https://patreon.com}{patreon.com}, \href{https://liberapay.com/}{liberapay.com}).

\item A critical mass is needed.

\item Commercialization harms the FOSS development.

\item Registration and payment process are too time-consuming.

\item The concept relies too much on trust and voluntariness $\rightarrow$ risk of low acceptance.

\item The central role of the FFI could, in the long term, lead to an unwanted dependence of certain projects on the FFI.

\item Positive feedback loops could lead to a crowding-out effect of smaller projects and thus reduce the diversity of active projects.

\item It is unclear how to deal with projects that already have other funding resource sources (Mozilla, Linux kernel, ...)
